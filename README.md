**Backgammon - Single Player vs Bot (Full Rules)** is a modern, fully responsive web game that brings a simplified yet rich version of the classic Backgammon experience to your browser. In this implementation, you play as “White” against a Bot (“Black”) following nearly complete rules—including hitting, the Bar for checkers, re-entry mechanics, and bearing off.

> The project is implemented using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The game layout is split into three main parts:
>
> - Two Bar areas (one for each player) on the sides.
> - A central board divided into two rows (points 13–24 on top and points 12–1 on bottom).
>
> The game logic enforces that if you have checkers on the Bar, you must re-enter them first before making any other moves.

## Overview

Backgammon is a game of strategy and chance. This web version allows you to play a full (albeit simplified) version of Backgammon against a Bot. The game includes:

- **Dice Rolling:** Roll two dice (with doubles giving four moves) to determine movement.
- **Checker Movement & Hitting:** Move your checkers according to standard rules. Landing on a point occupied by a single opponent checker sends that checker to the Bar.
- **Bar & Re-entry:** If you have checkers on the Bar, you must re-enter them using the dice before other moves.
- **Bearing Off:** When all your checkers are in your home board, you can bear them off.
- **Turn Management:** The game automatically switches turns between you (White) and the Bot (Black), with on-screen indicators.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices with a modern dark-themed interface.
- **Help Modal:** Built-in Help instructions guide players through the rules.
